1. Validation?
2. Access patterns? Read heavy or write heavy? Are certain times of day more popular?
3. DB is a toy right now--needs creds, shouldn't be a sqlite3 file. No production ML db is so small
  3a. Maybe more fixtures. 
that sqlite3 works.
4. Credential management: db creds and hugging face token shouldn't be constants
5. Who is allowed to do reads and writes?
6. Who is the user? How will they be expected to interface with this service? Should there
be a front-end?
7. If this is read-heavy, and certain queries are more popular than others, there should
be a caching layer.
8. Adding type hints, but I haven't touched Python since version 2.7 came out. 
9. Env variables for db name
10. Support for interacting with other embeddings--currently this just uses the default
embedding that comes with ChromaDB.
11. bulk add, delete, edit
12. add date of creation to metadata
13. Support for querying different collections.
14. Should handle submitting of docs with duplicate ids
16. More extensive test--have every parameter be missing for the POST request
